<h2>About</h2>
<p><font size="3">
The CSU-San Marcos Cycling and Triathlon teams are official club sports of the California State University at San Marcos. We welcome athletes at all levels from beginner to elite, and help them reach their endurance sports goals. We encourage participation from undergraduate, graduate, and credential students.  We also appreciate the support of the staff, faculty, alumni, and other members of the community. Again, all levels of experience are welcome, so stop by a workout and give it a try!</p>
 
<h2>Membership</h2>
The Cycling and Triathlon teams are tiered structure here at  CSU-San Marcos. This structure helps our coaches and captains design better training protocols, schedules, and allocate their resources both during and after team workouts. See below for information on the specific tiers.</p>

<p>Check out our calendar to see a schedule of workouts for the season, but be aware in the event of a schedule change, the team may not be at the locations listed on the calendar. The teams have a variety of workouts throughout the year.</p>

<p>Please come try us out if you are at all interested in being part of our program.

<h2>Club Tier</h2>

<p>This membership is geared to the "club athlete" that wants to do some training and racing without strict commitments. This is a great way to keep in shape and pickup a great hobby with no experience neccessary.</p>

<h2>Team Tier</h2>

<p>The Team Tier is for any team member who plans on aggressively competing in racing and increasing their performance levels.  Team tier  is is based on commitment to team workouts and development of the entire club.  This tier is for dedicated athletes who will attend nearly all training sessions and race a full season of events.  Benefits to joining team tier include priority access to funds for training, registration, and travel.</p>
